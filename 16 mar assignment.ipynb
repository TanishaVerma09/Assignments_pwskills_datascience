    "Overfitting and underfitting are two common issues that arise in machine learning when building predictive models. These issues can affect the performance and generalization ability of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns to perform extremely well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Essentially, the model memorizes the training data instead of capturing the underlying patterns. This leads to poor performance on new data because the model has learned noise and outliers present in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences of Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "High accuracy on the training data but low accuracy on the test/validation data.\n",
    "Increased sensitivity to noise in the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mitigation of Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Adding regularization terms to the loss function can help penalize overly complex models. Common regularization techniques include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Splitting the dataset into multiple folds and evaluating the model's performance on each fold helps to assess its generalization ability.\n",
    "Feature Selection: Removing irrelevant or redundant features can reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Early Stopping: Monitoring the performance on a validation set and stopping training when the performance starts to degrade can prevent the model from memorizing the training data.\n",
    "More Data: Increasing the size of the training dataset can help the model learn more generalizable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. As a result, it performs poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data. Underfitting can occur when the model is not complex enough to represent the relationships present in the data.\n",

    "Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to help the model capture relevant information.\n",
