    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each decision tree in the random forest contributes to the final prediction, and the algorithm is particularly effective at handling regression problems by reducing overfitting and increasing predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "a. Bootstrap Sampling: It uses bootstrapping to create multiple subsets of the training data, introducing diversity into the training process.\n",
    "b. Feature Randomization: At each split in a decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This helps reduce the tendency of individual trees to overfit.\n",
    "c. Averaging: The predictions from multiple decision trees are averaged (or aggregated), which helps smooth out noise and reduces the impact of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average of their individual predictions. When making a prediction for a new data point, each decision tree in the ensemble produces an output, and the final prediction is the average (or mean) of these outputs. This aggregation of predictions helps to reduce the variance and provide a more stable and accurate result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize its performance. Some of the key hyperparameters include:\n",
    "a. Number of Trees (n_estimators): The number of decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "b. Maximum Depth of Trees (max_depth): The maximum depth of each decision tree.\n",
    "c. Minimum Samples per Leaf (min_samples_leaf): The minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node in a tree.\n",
    "d. Maximum Features (max_features): The number of features to consider when splitting a node.\n",
    "e. Random State: A seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
    "a. Ensemble vs. Single Tree: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for prediction, while Decision Tree Regressor uses a single decision tree.\n",
    "b. Overfitting: Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting compared to Decision Tree Regressor due to its ensemble nature and feature randomization.\n",
    "c. Prediction: Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions from multiple trees to make a final prediction, whereas Decision Tree Regressor makes predictions based on a single tree's structure.\n",
    "d. Complexity: Decision Tree Regressor can create complex, deep trees, while Random Forest Regressor often uses shallow trees, which are less complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "a. Improved predictive accuracy.\n",
    "b. Robustness against overfitting.\n",
    "c. Handles a large number of features well.\n",
    "d. Ability to provide feature importance rankings.\n",
    "e. Works effectively for both regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "a. Can be computationally expensive with a large number of trees.\n",
    "b. May not provide as interpretable results as a single decision tree.\n",
    "c. Tuning hyperparameters can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value. It provides predictions for regression tasks, estimating the numerical target variable for the given input data point. The output is the average of predictions from individual decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Random Forest can be used for classification tasks as well. When used for classification, it's called a Random Forest Classifier. In this case, it classifies input data points into one of several classes or categories based on the majority vote of the individual decision trees in the ensemble. The key difference between Random Forest Regressor and Classifier lies in the type of output they provide (continuous numerical values for regression vs. discrete class labels for classification).\n",
