    "The mean is often used when the data is normally distributed or close to normally distributed. It gives a good representation of the central value when there are no significant outliers.\n",
    "The median is preferred when the data has outliers or is skewed, as it is less influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "The mode is useful for describing the most common value or category in the dataset and is commonly used with categorical data."
